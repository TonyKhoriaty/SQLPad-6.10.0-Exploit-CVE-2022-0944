# SQLPad 6.10.0 Exploit (CVE-2022-0944)

This Bash script exploits an RCE vulnerability in SQLPad 6.10.0, allowing an attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE) by abusing the `host` and `database` fields in SQLPad’s MySQL database connection settings. The exploit leverages SQLPad’s unsanitized handling of the `child_process` module in Node.js to execute arbitrary commands, ultimately opening a reverse shell on the attacker's machine.

## Prerequisites
1. **Netcat Listener**: Ensure you have a listener active on your machine with `nc -lvnp 9001`.
2. **Target Server Access**: This exploit assumes you can communicate with the vulnerable SQLPad instance.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository** (or copy the script locally).
2. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   ./exploit.sh
   ```

3. Follow the script prompts to input the target host and your IP address, then wait for a reverse shell connection.

## Details
- **CVE**: CVE-2022-0944
- **Affected Version**: SQLPad 6.10.0
- **Vulnerability**: Remote Code Execution (RCE) via template injection
- **Impact**: This exploit allows an attacker to execute commands on the target server with the privileges of the SQLPad process.
